# Data Analysis with Complex Queries

This project demonstrates advanced data analysis techniques using SQL within a MySQL environment, focusing on complex queries involving window functions, subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs). We leverage these powerful tools to perform in-depth analysis on a sample dataset, showcasing how they can simplify complex logic and improve query performance specifically within the MySQL ecosystem.

## Task Description

The primary goal of this project is to showcase proficiency in writing complex SQL queries for data analysis using MySQL. We aim to go beyond basic SELECT statements and explore the capabilities of window functions, subqueries, and CTEs to solve real-world analytical problems. Specifically, the project covers the following areas:

* Window Functions : We utilize window functions to perform calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row, without actually grouping the rows. This allows us to calculate running totals, moving averages, rank values, and other similar metrics within the original dataset. Examples include calculating the cumulative sum of sales for each region, ranking customers based on their purchase amount, and identifying the top performers in each department. We explore different window functions available in MySQL, such as `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `SUM() OVER()`, `AVG() OVER()`, etc., demonstrating their specific use cases and how they can be combined for more complex analysis within the constraints and capabilities of MySQL's window function support.  It's important to note that while MySQL supports many window functions, some advanced window functions available in other RDBMS might not be directly available or might require workarounds.

* Subqueries : We employ subqueries (queries nested within other queries) to break down complex analytical problems into smaller, manageable steps within MySQL. Subqueries can be used in the `WHERE` clause, `SELECT` clause, or `FROM` clause. We demonstrate how subqueries can be used to filter data based on aggregated values, calculate values that are then used in the outer query, and retrieve data that is then used to join with other tables. Examples include finding customers who have spent more than the average customer, identifying products that have sold more than a certain quantity, and comparing sales performance across different regions.  We pay attention to MySQL's specific subquery optimization strategies and potential performance considerations.

* Common Table Expressions (CTEs) : We utilize CTEs to improve the readability and maintainability of complex SQL queries within MySQL. A CTE is essentially a named temporary result set that can be referenced within a larger query. By breaking down complex queries into smaller, logical blocks represented by CTEs, we make the overall query easier to understand and debug. CTEs also allow us to reuse the same intermediate result set multiple times within a query, which can improve performance. We showcase how CTEs can be combined with window functions and subqueries to create even more powerful and elegant analytical solutions specifically within the MySQL environment.

* Combining Techniques : The project emphasizes the synergy between these three techniques within the context of MySQL. We demonstrate how window functions, subqueries, and CTEs can be combined to solve complex analytical problems that would be difficult or impossible to address using simpler SQL queries. For example, we might use a CTE to calculate the total sales for each customer, then use a window function to rank customers within each region based on their total sales, and finally use a subquery to identify the top N customers in each region.  We consider MySQL's query execution plan and how these combined techniques might impact performance.

## Resources Used

This project utilizes the following resources:

* MySQL Database:  This project is specifically designed for the MySQL relational database management system.  The SQL code provided is tailored to the syntax and features of MySQL.

* Sample Dataset: A sample dataset is essential for demonstrating the SQL queries within MySQL. This dataset should contain relevant information for the analysis, such as customer data, sales data, product data, etc. The structure and content of the dataset will influence the specific queries written. The dataset should be of sufficient size and complexity to showcase the power of the advanced SQL techniques used. A description of the dataset schema (tables and columns) should be included in the project documentation. The data can be imported into MySQL using various methods (e.g., `LOAD DATA INFILE`, `mysqlimport`).

* MySQL Client/IDE: A MySQL client or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is used to write, execute, and test the SQL queries. Examples include MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, DBeaver, and DataGrip. The choice of MySQL client is largely a matter of personal preference.

* Documentation: This README file serves as the primary documentation for the project. It describes the task, the resources used, and the approach taken. The SQL code itself should be well-commented to explain the logic behind each query. Additional documentation, such as a description of the dataset schema and the specific business questions being addressed, may also be included.
